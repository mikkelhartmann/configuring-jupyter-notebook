# Introduction

This repository contains a collection of dot files and other tricks for customizing the look and workflow of Jupyter Notebooks. I have created [a Notebook](https://github.com/mikkelhartmann/configuring-jupyter-notebook/blob/master/configuring-jupyter-notebook.ipynb) that demonstrates how this works.

The main idea is to use four different files to set default for what extensions are used, how the backend renders figures, which defaults MatplotLib uses as well as a custom CSS file thats used when rendering the notebook.

The Notebook also contains some trick that I have found very useful.

This is still very much work in progress as I'm constantly learning new cool things about Jupyter Notebook.
